# AJAX and the Web Request Response Cycle

**Author**: Tom and Max
**Version**: 1.5.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- This application allows the user to retrieve stored data from a remote directory.   -->

## Getting Started
<!-- The user must clone our repo from Github to receive the files needed. Then the user simply needs to open the index.html page in their browser. The articles should automatically populate the webpage -->

## Architecture
<!--The current build is refrencing a local directory, however it can easily be modified to include truely remote directories. After the information requests are recieved by the remote, the data is pushed back to the local directory, where it is placed into a template that populates the webpage with correctly formatted articles. -->
