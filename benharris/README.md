#### Single-line Summary
Today, Ben Harris soloed this lab, and it took me about 2-hours to complete.

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, I reviewed the code and added comments to each of the key parts to organize the code. I have found this to be a good practice when dealing with foreign code. 
  2. Next, I answered the questions throughout the markup.
  3. Finally, I added the missing code to article.js to make the page load the data into localStorage, and added the necessary if/then conditional statement to check if the data first exists.
